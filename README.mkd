# SQL Languages

## 1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
- **Definition:** DDL statements are used to define the database structure or schema.
- **Commands:**
    - `CREATE`: Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in the database.
    - `ALTER`: Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.
    - `DROP`: Deletes an entire table, a view of a table, or other objects in the database.
    - `TRUNCATE`: Removes all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records.
    - `COMMENT`: Adds comments to the data dictionary.
    - `RENAME`: Renames an object.

## 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- **Definition:** DML statements are used for managing data within schema objects.
- **Commands:**
    - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from the database.
    - `INSERT`: Inserts data into a table.
    - `UPDATE`: Updates existing data within a table.
    - `DELETE`: Deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remains.
    - `MERGE`: Performs `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations in a single statement.

## 3. DCL (Data Control Language)
- **Definition:** DCL statements control access to data within the database.
- **Commands:**
    - `GRANT`: Gives user's access privileges to the database.
    - `REVOKE`: Withdraws user's access privileges given by using the `GRANT` command.

## 4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
- **Definition:** TCL statements manage the changes made by DML statements.
- **Commands:**
    - `COMMIT`: Saves the work done.
    - `ROLLBACK`: Restores the database to the original since the last `COMMIT`.
    - `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a savepoint within a transaction.
    - `SET TRANSACTION`: Places a name on a transaction.

## 5. DQL (Data Query Language)
- **Definition:** DQL is used to query the database and retrieve data.
- **Commands:**
    - `SELECT`: Retrieves data from the database. (Note: `SELECT` is often categorized under DML, but it can also be considered part of DQL as it is primarily used for querying data.)
